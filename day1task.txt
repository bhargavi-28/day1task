1) difference between http1.1 and http2 
answer: 
http 1.1 : There is head of line blocking that blocks all the requests behind it until it doesn’t get its all resources.
It uses requests resource Inlining for use getting multiple pages
It compresses data by itself.
whereras http2 , It allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for multiple requests.
HTTP/2 is able to use a single TCP connection to send multiple streams of data at once so that no one resource blocks any other resource.


2)Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript
anwer: objects in JavaScript may be defined as an unordered collection of related data, of primitive or reference types, in the form of “key: value” pairs. 
These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively, in the context of an object.
For Eg. If your object is a student, it will have properties like name, age, address, id, etc and methods like updateAddress, updateNam, etc.
